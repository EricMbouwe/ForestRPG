## Game Play

You are a hero in a Fantasy Forest World where nuclear waste has created made trees walk around and turned moles into large beasts. The Treants and Moles are preventing you from continuing on your jouney to find other humans. Once you have killed atleast 6 enemies a mountain door open so you can continue to find a cure for this chaos. The faster you get kills, the higher the chances of you finding a cure.

You (and your 3 lives) head to the forest, armed with a bow and arrows to kill the enemies as quickly as possible. Ammo costs points so try to use as little as possible.

Any contact with an enemy is deadly and you lose a life. Try to kill as many enemies as possible before exiting the area through the mountain door to get the highest score.

Don't forget to post your score to the global leaderboard!
